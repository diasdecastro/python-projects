# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer! Here you watch how pathfinding algorithms search for the path to the goal.

# Requirements

Python 3.x \
Pygame

# Instructions

**First select the starting point (blue) and the goal (red) by clicking** \
**You can draw walls (white) after selecting the start and goal by holding the left mouse button and draging the mouse** \
**Press a number to select the algorithm:** \
\
**Num 1 = Dijkstra's Algorithm** \
**Num 2 = A\* Algorithm** \
**Num 3 = Breadth-First Search** \
**Num 4 = Greedy Best-First Search** \
\
**Alter selecting the algorithm press Space to start the pathfinding process** \
**Press the the right mouse button to undo the selection of the start, end and walls (doesn't work while the algorithm is still running)**
